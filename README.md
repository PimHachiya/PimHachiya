Personally, coding for the greater good.  Writing to answer some of the greater questions in my household: â€˜Did you feed the dog today?â€™ and â€˜Did you wash my wool sweater?â€™  
Hopfully the answers are 'Yes' and 'No' in that order.....


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an application to track who fed our dog... He can always eat and there are more than two opposable thumbs in play.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning using tensor flow to answer some ML questions.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything OMIC, flow cytometry or things related to cell imaging.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with FIGMA and getting an IOS compatible app off its feet.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about assay miniturization, books and biotech.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tag me here to say hello~
